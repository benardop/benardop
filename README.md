# Hi, I'm Benard 👋🏾

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0nica/M0nica/master/gh-header-image-cropped.png" alt="banner that says Monica Powell - software engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Monica">
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about developing high quality software solutions and creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Java, Ruby, Rails, ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup). In 2022, I was admitted to Microverse to start training on full-stack web development skills.
